# CEGE0042 Predicting Food Security with Random Forests

This project will evaluate the performance of a Radom Forest algorithm in classifying food insecurity whilst accounting for space-time components. Food insecurity exists when a population does not have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life (Santeramo, 2015). Due to its complex multifaceted nature, food insecurity is notoriously difficult to measure and predict. In recent years, the proliferation of machine learning and big data have allowed for better quantification of social phenomena across disciplines, particularly with the use of Random Forest (RF) algorithms. However, RFâ€™s applied in food insecurity research tend to produce diverging accuracy scores depending on the type of data used. For instance, studies have shown that RF classifiers only including qualitative social data produce accuracy rates of 64% (Hossain, et al., 2019) whereas RF classifiers focusing on remote sensing data perform at 90% accuracy (Lebrini, et al., 2020). In an attempt to bridge this performance gap, this project will evaluate an RF model that incorporates both social data and remote sensing data, whilst also accounting for spatial temporal autocorrelations.
